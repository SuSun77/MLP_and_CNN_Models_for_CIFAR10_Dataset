# CIFAR10
Construc three models for CIFAR10 dataset.   
One simple MLP model, one CNN1 model without implementing any method to avoid overfitting and one CNN2 model which has the best result.   
To save computation, only 20% training sample and 5 epochs were run.   
The accuracy would be higher if running for a longer time.
